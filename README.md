# Pokec Social Network Analysis
This project analyzes the Pokec social network, focusing on degree distribution and centrality measures to understand the network's structure and key user roles.

# Overview
The Pokec social network dataset is a comprehensive set of user relationships and profiles.Pokec is the most popular Slovak on-line social network. These datasets are anonymized and contains relationships and user profile data of the whole network. Profile data are in Slovak language. Datasets were crawled during MAY 25-27 2012.

# Our analysis aims to:
- Understand connectivity patterns.
- Reveal network structure.
- Identify influential users.
- To be continued...

# Key Components
- Data Download: Scripts to download and preprocess the Pokec dataset.
- Graph Creation: Code to create a graph representation of the network.
- Degree Distribution Analysis: Examination of the node degree to understand user connectivity.
- Centrality Measures: Calculation of degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality to identify key users.
- To be continued....
